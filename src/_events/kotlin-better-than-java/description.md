__Know some basic programming? Don't really like Java that much?__

In this workshop, run by our Dev Officer Daniel Cordell, you'll gain a basic understanding of the Kotlin programming language over two weeks, its similarities and differenes to Java, and why it's can be a nicer language to use.

This event is open to anybody, no matter how much experience you have! While having some Java experience would be useful, it shuld not be necessary to understand some of the concepts explained.
